                <p>A more in depth, feature complete version of Game Jam version of Grave Diver</p>
                <H3 class="desc-header">Here's what I did:</H3>
                <p>Every single piece of UI in game is programmed by me. All menus, tooltips, combat HUD. I also programmed most of the games most essential underlying pieces, 
                    such as the unit combat, levelling up units, and the most important piece, the shop! I worked on this game for about 7 months straight, constantly improving upon
                    the game jam base that was previously there. The MVC pattern is all over this game, as well as the Entity-Component model. 
                </p>
                <p>My teammates were absent for most of the games development, so aside from their contributions to the initial game jam version of the project, what you see here listed
                    on my portfolio was mainly just me solo developing this project. I received some additional programming help from a group mate a couple times on the XP system
                    for the units, new unit art, as well as design suggestions, but aside from that it was just me.
                </p>
                <p>I also contributed a bunch of pixel art to the project. Various units, UI elements, character portraits, and even basic 3D models for the progression aspect
                    of the game. 
                </p>

                <p>Secure your job at a struggling pizza restaurant in the middle of a warzone. <i>Made for Brackey's Game Jam 2024.</i></p>
                <H3 class="desc-header">Here's what I did:</H3>
                <p>Programmed and designed the UI for the entire game, including but not limited to: Pizza counter and timer for the car section, The end of day scoring screen, 
                    The win \ lose ending screens, The world space UI elements such as the pizza order display and the pizza menu. The interact prompt was co-programmed with another member
                    of the group. 
                </p>
                <p>Designed most of the inital aspects of the game, including what pizza toppings to include, what the menu items should consist of, and how the respective sections of the game
                    should work. Most of the art in the game (that is not a royalty free asset listed in the credits) was made by me. The layout and interior of the pizzeria was designed and modeled by me, as well
                    as the map for the car section. I also drew the logo for the game.
                </p>
                <p>I contributed a lot of additional programming to the project, such as miscellaneous bug fixes, the intital video player for the TV, 
                    random mesh \ material generation for the cars on the map, and various sound effect triggers.

            <H3 class="desc-header">Here's what I did:</H3>
                <p>I was responsible for the initial idea for the game, which is heavily inspired by the original Halloween movie. I was also responsible for the level design of the project.
                    I designed and 3D modeled the layout of the map. Most of the 3D models in the game were done by me, as well as the water shader. 
                </p>
                <p>I handled most of the ambience of the enviroment, including the spatial audio. I also helped with some additional programming, such as the Event for the head falling from the vent 
                    in the ceiling.

            <H3 class="desc-header">Here's what I did:</H3>
                <p>
                    All of the UI in the game was programmed by me, as well as all if not most of the other programming in the game. I took the basis of the part system, and the initial
                    shooting of the weapons from my teammates, and heavily modified / transformed it. I also designed all of the parts for the weapons, all of the game design aspects, and
                    the basic level design for the project. While the project is not feature complete, there is the barebones of a really exciting procedural looter shooter. This project was 
                    mainly inspired by Borderlands, and was created by me in 6 or so months.

                <p>
                    I came up with the core idea of the game, which is a puzzle platformer utilizing a mechanic that allows you to change the way the level is laid out. This mechanic 
                    was heavily inspired by Titanfall 2, which features a campaign mission with a similar mechanic. I was responsible for all of the UI in the game, such as the menus and
                    various NPC text boxes. I also contributed some small art to the project, such as various NPC designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in tandem with a group partner, designed 2 massive levels, featuring about 10 screens of platforming puzzles each.
